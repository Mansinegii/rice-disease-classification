# üåæ Rice Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting and classifying four types of rice leaf diseases ‚Äî **Bacterial Blight**, **Blast**, **Brown Spot**, and **Tungro** ‚Äî using a **DenseNet121-based deep learning model** with the **Adam optimizer**. The approach involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizing results like accuracy/loss curves, confusion matrix, ROC, and metric histograms.

## üìÅ Dataset

- Dataset Source: **Mendeley Data** and **Kaggle**
- Contains labeled rice leaf images of 4 disease classes:
  - Bacterial Blight
  - Blast
  - Brown Spot
  - Tungro
- Images were resized to 150x150 for model compatibility

---

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The model is built using **DenseNet121 (pre-trained)** with a custom classification head:

- GlobalAveragePooling2D
- BatchNormalization
- Dropout (rate=0.4)
- Dense(256, activation='relu')
- Output Dense(4, activation='softmax')

Other tested models: CNN, MobileNet, VGG16.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training Configuration

- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Epochs:** 30
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Data Augmentation:** Rotation, Flipping, Zoom, Rescale
