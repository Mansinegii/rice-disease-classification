# Rice Leaf Disease Classification

A deep learning project using transfer learning (DenseNet121) to classify rice leaf diseases. Trained on images from Mendeley Data using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Structure
- `data loader.py` – Loads and preprocesses data
- `model create.py` – Builds the CNN model
- `trained model.py` – Trains and saves the model
- `plot_results.py` – Evaluates model and visualizes results

## Dataset
Rice Leaf Disease Dataset from Mendeley Data.
