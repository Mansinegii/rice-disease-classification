# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Leaf Disease Classification using DenseNet121 with Adam Optimizer

This project focuses on the classification of rice leaf diseasesâ€”Bacterial Blight, Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, and Tungroâ€”using the DenseNet121 deep learning model. The goal is to enhance classification accuracy under intra-class variability.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

- **Architecture**: DenseNet121
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Dataset**: Kaggle + Mendeley Rice Leaf Disease Dataset
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy

## ðŸ“Š Results

| Metric         | Score   |
|----------------|---------|
| Accuracy       | 95.2%   |
| Precision      | 94.9%   |
| Recall         | 94.6%   |
| F1-score       | 94.7%   |
